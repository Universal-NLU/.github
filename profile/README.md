## Welcome to the Universal Natural Language Understanding project

- ðŸ”¬ This page provides code and data created as part of the UNLU project, funded by the [Research Council of Norway](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/en/project/FORISS/300495?Kilde=FORISS&distribution=Ar&chart=bar&calcType=funding&Sprak=no&sortBy=date&sortOrder=desc&resultCount=30&offset=0&TemaEmne.2=eVitenskap)
- The [UNLU repository](https://github.com/Universal-NLU/UNLU) includes the semantic translation rules that form the core of the project, along with code for running the pipeline that converts Universal Dependencies representations into Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs). See [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.udw-1.6.pdf) for more details.
- The [DRASTIC repository](https://github.com/Universal-NLU/DRASTIC) contains a continually-growing dataset of sentences and their corresponding DRS representations, with an emphasis on naturally-occuring, longer sentences. See [this paper](https://dmr2023.github.io/pdf/2023.dmr-1.9.pdf) for more details.
